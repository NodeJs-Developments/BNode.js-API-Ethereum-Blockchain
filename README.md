## Things I've learned while building this
* Building the blockchain class with its required functionality.
* Accessing the blockchain with express API.
* Creating a decentralized blockchain network.
* Synchronizing the entire network.
* Create Consensus.
* Building Block Explorer (UI tool to view blockchain data) etc..

## Running the APP locally

### Prerequisites
1. NodeJS:
Please install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.15.0. If you already have it, you're good to go.

2. Yarn:
Visit Yarn [download page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Select your Operating system and follow the instructions.

Once you have the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) covered:

1. Clone this repository from GitHub onto your local computer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NodeJs-Developments/Node.js-API-Ethereum-Blockchain.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder and install all of its necessary dependencies with Yarn.

```
npm install
npm install ganache-cli -g
```
3. Start the server and we have to initialize Truffle
```sh
npm start
truffle init
ganache-cli
truffle compile
